# Reddit Search
This **Chromium extension** allows you to easily search reddit by using
Google's search engine. I've created this as an alternative to Reddit's
sometimes unreliable search.

## Requirements
* [Chromium](https://chromium.woolyss.com/) because [Google Chrome forcibly disables
the extension](https://blog.chromium.org/2015/05/continuing-to-protect-chrome-users-from.html)

## Installation steps
1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/tamj0rd2/reddit_search/releases) page
2. Download the *search_reddit.crx* for the latest release
3. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Drag and drop the downloaded *search_reddit.crx* file onto the page
5. Click *Add Extension*

  choice)
